# CS2015
Welcome. This repository contains materials for [MOSI](mosi.org)'s 2015 Home School Computer Science Class. All documents required for this course will posted here for convenient access in the computer lab and at home. Below is a desciption of the class.
>Let's take a different approach towards high school math education with a focus on introductory computer programming. Programming is the process of instructing computers to carry out certain tasks - any games, software, application, etc. on a computer was created by a human through programming. Students will learn the basics of the Java programming language and computational thinking, through project-based learning in class and practice study at home. 

##Processing - What is it? and how to download.
This class will be using [Processing](processing.org) to complete all homework assignments and in-class projects. Processing is a very user friendly tool for learning how to code and has a large amount of resources for learning online. To see example projects, go to [this](https://processing.org/examples/) page and explore some of the links.

To Download, click [here](https://processing.org/download/) to pull up processing's website. Processing is available for free, but also accepts donations if you are inclined to do so. Select a donation amount (custom amount or no donation) and then click "Download" below. On the next page, choose your operating system and the download will begin. Open up the downloaded folder and copy the inside folder onto your desktop or anywhere else on your computer. Open that folder and inside you will find the processing application.

##Github
All class materials (aside from video tutorials - more on that later) will be right here on Github. You may be thinking... What is Github and why is this website useful? Github is used by programmers to collaborate on projects together and keep their code as organized as possible. Think of it basically as a fancy hard drive on the internet. For the purpase of this class, Github will only be used to host documents that I want you all to see. There's a lot of cool and exciting things to do on here, but we will not be many of them. If you want to learn more about the nuts and bolts of Github, click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyfwLX4HAxM&list=PLg7s6cbtAD15G8lNyoaYDuKZSKyJrgwB-&index=1) to watch some tutorial videos.

##Youtube Video Content
Along with in-class content I will record and post videos to the [MOSI Tech Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWa3hzEDpYG_clePNQVmciA/feed). Each week, new videos will be posted to Youtube and linked on our class repo. You will not need to make a Youtube account to view these videos. Just click on the link and start watching!
